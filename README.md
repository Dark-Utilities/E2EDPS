## End-to-End Data Protection System (E2EDPS)

The **End-to-End Data Protection System (E2EDPS)** is a novel protocol designed to enhance data privacy and security in digital communications. By leveraging **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**, E2EDPS ensures the confidentiality and integrity of user data through a unique private key-based authentication mechanism and dual encryption strategy.

### Features

- **Client-Side Encryption**: User data is encrypted on the client-side before transmission, ensuring that it remains secure throughout its lifecycle.
- **Robust Authentication**: Utilizes a 64-character private key for secure authentication, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Designed to be 100% strict censorship resistant, allowing users to maintain control over their data without interference.
- **Protection Against Third-Party Access**: The system prevents unauthorized access even in scenarios involving third-party intermediaries or cyber-criminals.

### System Architecture

E2EDPS operates on a client-server architecture where:
- The client encrypts data before sending it to the server.
- The server manages encrypted data without ever accessing it in plaintext.

### Security Measures

1. **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensures sensitive information is never exposed to the server or third-party services.
2. **Key Management**: Unique private keys for each user minimize key compromise risks.
3. **Robust Authentication**: Strong authentication mechanisms enhance security against unauthorized access.
4. **Censorship Resistance**: Users can freely express themselves and access information without fear of suppression.

### Future Work

Future developments will focus on optimizing system performance and exploring additional cryptographic techniques to further enhance security.
