## Research Paper: End-to-End Data Protection System (E2EDPS)

## Abstract

In the age of digital communication, data privacy and security have become paramount concerns. This paper presents the End-to-End Data Protection System (E2EDPS), a novel protocol that leverages elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data. By employing a unique private key-based authentication mechanism and a dual encryption strategy, E2EDPS aims to provide robust protection against unauthorized access, even in scenarios involving third-party intermediaries.

## 1. Introduction

The increasing reliance on cloud services and web applications has raised significant concerns regarding data privacy and security. Traditional authentication methods often expose sensitive information to potential breaches. E2EDPS addresses these challenges by implementing a system where user data is encrypted on the client-side before transmission, ensuring that it remains secure throughout its lifecycle.

### 1.1 Motivation

The motivation behind E2EDPS stems from the need for a secure communication framework that protects user data from unauthorized access, especially in environments where third-party services are involved. By utilizing a 64-character private key for authentication and data encryption, E2EDPS provides a streamlined approach to secure data handling.

### 1.2 Objectives

-   To develop a protocol that ensures end-to-end encryption of user data.
-   To implement a secure authentication mechanism based on a private key login system.
-   To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system in real-world scenarios.

## 2. System Architecture

E2EDPS is designed around a client-server architecture where the client is responsible for encrypting data before sending it to the server. The server, in turn, manages the encrypted data without ever accessing it in plaintext. The architecture consists of the following components:

### 2.1 Key Generation

The system generates a random private key, which serves as the foundation for all cryptographic operations. This key is unique to each user and is used for both signing messages and decrypting data.

### 2.2 Public Key Derivation

From the private key, a corresponding public key is derived using the secp256k1 elliptic curve on the browser side. When a user logs in, the browser sends the hashed version of the private key (hashed client-side) to the server, ensuring that the raw private key is never transmitted. The server checks if this hashed private key exists in its database to verify user existence and responds with its own public key.

### 2.3 Data Encryption and Decryption

Data is encrypted on the client-side using the public key before transmission. Upon receiving the data, the server stores it securely without decrypting it. The user's private key is also utilized to encrypt sensitive information such as their name or any other personal data before it is stored in the database. This information can later be decrypted client-side when needed.

## 3. Cryptographic Operations

### 3.1 Key Generation

The private key is generated using a secure random number generator, ensuring that it is unpredictable and unique. The generation process is implemented as follows:

```javascript
static generatePrivateKey(): string {
    const randomBytes = new Uint8Array(64);
    crypto.getRandomValues(randomBytes);
    return Array.from(randomBytes, (byte) => byte.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
}
```

### 3.2 Hashing

To enhance security, the private key is hashed using the SHA-512 algorithm on the client side. This process ensures that the private key is not stored in plaintext:

```javascript
static async getPrivateKeyHash(privateKey: string): Promise<string> {
    const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-512', new TextEncoder().encode(privateKey));
    return Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer))
        .map((byte) => byte.toString(16).padStart(2, '0'))
        .join('');
}
```

### 3.3 Signing and Verification

Messages are signed using the private key, providing a mechanism for verifying the authenticity of the sender:

```javascript
static async signMessage(privateKey: string, message: string): Promise<string> {
    const ec = new elliptic.ec('secp256k1');
    return ec.keyFromPrivate(Buffer.from(privateKey, 'hex')).sign(message).toDER('hex');
}
```

### 3.4 Encryption and Decryption

Data is encrypted using the public key and decrypted using the private key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can access the plaintext data:

```javascript
static async encryptMessage(publicKey: string, message: string): Promise<string> {
    const ec = new elliptic.ec('secp256k1');
    const publicKeyBuffer = Buffer.from(ec.keyFromPublic(publicKey, 'hex').getPublic().encode('array', false));
    const cryptoKey = await crypto.subtle.importKey('raw', publicKeyBuffer, { name: 'RSA-OAEP', hash: 'SHA-256' }, true, ['encrypt']);
    const encrypted = await crypto.subtle.encrypt({ name: 'RSA-OAEP' }, cryptoKey, new TextEncoder().encode(message));
    return Buffer.from(new Uint8Array(encrypted)).toString('hex');
}
```

## 4. Security Analysis

E2EDPS employs several security measures to ensure data protection:

### 4.1 End-to-End Encryption

By encrypting data on the client-side, E2EDPS ensures that sensitive information is never exposed to the server or any third-party services.

### 4.2 Key Management

The use of a unique private key for each user minimizes the risk of key compromise. Additionally, hashing of the private key adds an extra layer of security since only hashed values are stored on the server.

### 4.3 Robust Authentication

The implementation of a private key login system with a strong 64-character private key serves as an effective authentication mechanism, making it difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

## 5. Conclusion

The End-to-End Data Protection System (E2EDPS) represents a significant advancement in secure data handling practices. By integrating elliptic curve cryptography and a unique private key-based authentication system, E2EDPS provides a robust framework for protecting user data against unauthorized access while ensuring that all communications are encrypted end-to-end. Future work will focus on optimizing system performance and exploring additional cryptographic techniques to enhance security.
